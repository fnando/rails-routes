Too many routes on your Rails app? Me too! This gem allows you to separate your
routes on different files. Just create them at `config/routes/*.rb` and you're
good to go.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "rails-routes"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rails-routes

## Usage

After adding this gem to your project, you can create multiple route files
inside `config/routes`. Just make sure you wrap your routes with

```ruby
# config/routes/v1.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  namespace :v1 do
    resources :things
  end
end

# config/routes/v2.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  namespace :v2 do
    resources :things
  end
end
```

The routes will be reloaded in development; if you create or remove files, you
have to restart your server.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push
git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
